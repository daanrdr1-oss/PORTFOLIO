"[""Please answer with true or false based on the information:     text: On the outbreak of war, the Confederates seized many of the state's army camps, though the Union retained control of the main seaports. There was little fighting in Florida, the only major conflict being the Battle of Olustee near Lake City in February 1864. However, wartime conditions made it easier for slaves to escape, and many of them became useful informers to Union commanders. As southern morale suffered, deserters from both sides took refuge in Florida, often attacking Confederate units and looting farms. In May 1865, Federal control was re-established, slavery abolished, and the state governor John Milton shot himself, rather than submit to Union occupation.    question: were any civil war battles fought in florida    answer:      true.   question: did the confederates retain control of the main seaports in florida during the civil war    answer:     false.\n\nAdditionally, it's worth noting that the information provided in the text is generally accurate, but it's important to remember that the Civil War in Florida was complex and multifaceted, with various factors contributing to the dynamics of the conflict. The text touches upon some of these factors, but it's essential to remember that there were many other aspects of the war in Florida that are not mentioned.""]"
"[""Please answer with true or false based on the information:     text: The ground squirrels are members of the squirrel family of rodents (Sciuridae) which generally live on or in the ground, rather than trees. The term is most often used for the medium-sized ground squirrels, as the larger ones are more commonly known as marmots (genus Marmota) or prairie dogs, while the smaller and less bushy-tailed ground squirrels tend to be known as chipmunks. Together, they make up the ``marmot tribe'' of squirrels, Marmotini, and the large and mainly ground squirrel subfamily Xerinae, and containing six living genera. Well-known members of this largely Holarctic group are the marmots (Marmota), including the American groundhog, the chipmunks, the susliks (Spermophilus), and the prairie dogs (Cynomys). They are highly variable in size and habitus, but most are remarkably able to rise up on their hind legs and stand fully erect comfortably for prolonged periods. They also tend to be far more gregarious than other squirrels, and many live in colonies with complex social structures. Most Marmotini are rather short-tailed and large squirrels, and the alpine marmot (Marmota marmota) is the largest living member of the Sciuridae, at 53--73 cm in length and weighing 5--8 kg.    question: is a chipmunk the same as a ground squirrel    answer:      false.  A chipmunk is a type of ground squirrel, but not all ground squirrels are chipmunks. The terms are related but distinct.""]"

"[""Please answer with true or false based on the information:     text: Baby back ribs (also back ribs or loin ribs) are taken from the top of the rib cage between the spine and the spare ribs, below the loin muscle. They have meat between the bones and on top of the bones, and are shorter, curved, and sometimes meatier than spare ribs. The rack is shorter at one end, due to the natural tapering of a pig's rib cage. The shortest bones are typically only about 3 in (7.6 cm) and the longest is usually about 6 in (15 cm), depending on the size of the hog. A pig side has 15 to 16 ribs (depending on the breed), but usually two or three are left on the shoulder when it is separated from the loin. So, a rack of back ribs contains a minimum of eight ribs (some may be trimmed if damaged), but can include up to 13 ribs, depending on how it has been prepared by the butcher. A typical commercial rack has 10--13 bones. If fewer than 10 bones are present, butchers call them ``cheater racks''.    question: are back ribs same as baby back ribs    answer:      False. Back ribs and baby back ribs are not the same. Back ribs are taken from the top of the rib cage between the spine and the spare ribs, below the loin muscle, while baby back ribs are a specific type of back ribs, shorter, curved, and sometimes meatier than spare ribs.""]"
