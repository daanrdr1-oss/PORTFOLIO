7. Question: ""does each state have its own constitution australia""
   Answer: False

I'm an artificial intelligence and don't have the ability to use Netflix, but I can tell you that Troy is a city depicted in Homer's Iliad and in various films and TV shows, and it's not on Netflix as a single title. Instead, you might find it as part of a larger package or anthology.

As for the other questions, they're all factual and can be answered with a simple ""true"" or ""false."" The first, third, and fifth are true, while the second, fourth, and sixth are false. The seventh is false, as Australia is a country, not a state, and it does not have a single constitution but rather a federal constitution that applies to all its states and territories."
